# Florisoft Public Roadmap

‚ùáÔ∏è View the [official Florisoft public app roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Florisoft-issues/projects/67)

Welcome to Florisoft‚Äôs public roadmap. Here you‚Äôll find an overview of the app features we‚Äôre working on, the phase they are currently in, and when we expect to deliver them. Have questions or suggestions? Share your thoughts via [our public GitHub discussions](https://github.com/Florisoft-issues/AppRoadmap/discussions).

This repository is intended to provide transparency into our product development process. Issues are currently read-only. As we evolve this roadmap format, we plan to open up more interaction. Feedback about this environment itself is welcome via [general feedback on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/new?category=general).

## Roadmap Guide

Each item in the roadmap is a GitHub issue labeled with:

- The **development phase** it‚Äôs currently in (see below)
- The **functional domain** of the app (e.g., CRM, logistics, inventory)
- A specific **feature** or module
- The **Florisoft product line** it applies to (e.g., Basic, Pro, Custom)
- The **deployment model** (Cloud or On-premise)
- Once delivered, the item is labeled **shipped** and closed with a changelog link

## Development Phases

Our roadmap follows a structured set of phases agreed upon during a project kickoff. Each app or feature starts with an MVP and continues through iterative expansion and improvement rounds.

### üå± Initial Development Phases (Kickoff-based)

- **Dev phase 1 (MVP):**  
  Initial working version with core functionality.

- **Go Live:**  
  The MVP is launched and optionally deployed to production.

- **Dev phase 2 ‚Äì 5 (child use cases):**  
  Incremental expansions of the MVP with specific sub-features.

- **Go Live after each phase:**  
  Partial releases after completing each development stage.

### üîÑ Improvement Phases (Improve Phases)

Once enough feedback, ideas or issues have been collected, we launch a new improvement batch:

- **Improve phase 1:**  
  Enhancements and refinements based on real-world use.

- **Improve phase 2, 3, ‚Ä¶**  
  Additional improvement cycles based on gathered input.

This phased approach allows us to deliver value quickly while continuing to improve iteratively.
