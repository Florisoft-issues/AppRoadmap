# Florisoft Public Roadmap

‚ùáÔ∏è Check out the [official public app roadmap of Florisoft](https://github.com/orgs/Florisoft-issues/projects/67)

Welcome to the public roadmap of Florisoft. Here you‚Äôll find an overview of the app features we‚Äôre working on, their current development stage, and expected release timelines. Questions or suggestions? Join the conversation via [our public GitHub discussions](https://github.com/Florisoft-issues/AppRoadmap/discussions).

This repository is meant to offer transparency into our product development. Issues are currently read-only. In the future, we aim to broaden interactions and refine the roadmap format. Feedback on this environment itself is welcome via [general GitHub feedback](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/new?category=general).

## Roadmap Guide

Each roadmap item is a GitHub issue with labels indicating:

- The **development phase** it‚Äôs in (see below)
- The **functional area** within our apps (e.g., Logistics, Sales, Inventory)
- A specific **feature** or module
- Once delivered, the item receives a **delivered** label and is closed with a link to the changelog

---

## Development Phases

Our roadmap is structured around fixed development phases, as discussed during project kickoffs. Every app or feature goes through at least an MVP phase, followed by iterative enhancements and improvements.

### üå± Initial Development Phases (Kickoff-Based)

- **Dev phase 1 (MVP):**  
  The first working version with core functionality.

- **Go-live:**  
  MVP is delivered and potentially deployed in production.

- **Dev phase 2 ‚Äì 5 (child use cases):**  
  Refinements and enhancements to the MVP with targeted additional features.

- **Go-live after each phase:**  
  Intermediate deliveries following the completion of each phase.

### üîÑ Improvement Phases

Once enough feedback, ideas, or bugs have been collected, we start a new improvement round:

- **Improve phase 1:**  
  Optimizations and UX improvements based on real-world use.

- **Improve phase 2, 3, ‚Ä¶**  
  Follow-up phases handling batches of new enhancements.

This approach allows us to deliver value quickly while continuously improving.
