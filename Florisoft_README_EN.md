Welcome to the public **Florisoft Roadmap**. This environment provides an up-to-date and structured overview of the app functionalities we are working on, including their status and expected delivery timelines.

**This repository covers the following topics:**
1. [Roadmap Structure & Guidelines](#1-roadmap-structure--guidelines)  
2. [Development Phases](#2-development-phases)  
3. [App Structure: Functional Domains, Applications, and Use Cases](#3-app-structure-functional-domains-applications-and-use-cases)

The current roadmap is intended to provide our users with insights into our product development. At a later stage, we aim to broaden interaction, refine the format, and offer you the opportunity to actively contribute.

The discussion channel allows you to stay informed about announcements, such as the delivery of an application or the introduction of new features. You can find this channel via the following link: [GitHub Discussions ‚Äì AppRoadmap](https://github.com/Florisoft-issues/AppRoadmap/discussions).

All changes and updates are also available in the changelog: [Changelog Florisoft](https://app.florisoft.nl/apps/latest/changelog.html).

## 1. Roadmap Structure & Guidelines

Upon opening the public roadmap, you will see a **complete overview** of all app developments, including the timeline in which the development is planned, ongoing, or completed. You can filter the overview using the specified tabs or the search functionality at the top of the page.

Each development is linked to a GitHub issue, containing the following information:

- Short description of the **functionality(-ies)**
- The **development phase** of the roadmap item*
- The relevant **application**
- The **functional domain** of the application (e.g., Logistics, Sales, Inventory)*
- The **use case** or specific **feature** *
- Once delivered, the item receives the label **Delivered** and is closed with a link to the changelog.

* More information about the structure of the development phases, functional domains, applications, and use cases can be found below.

## 2. Development Phases

Our roadmap is structured around fixed development phases, as discussed during the kick-off of each project. Every app, use case, or feature goes through at least an MVP phase (Minimum Viable Product ‚Äì an initial version with core functionality that is quickly deployable), followed by iterative enhancements and extensions. Below is a short description of each specific phase:

### üå± Initial Development Phases (Kick-off Based)

- **Dev phase 1 (MVP):**  
    First working version with essential functionality.

- **Go-Live:**  
    MVP is delivered and possibly deployed to production.

- **Dev phase 2 ‚Äì 5 (Child Use Cases):**  
    Refinement and expansion of the MVP with additional specific functionalities.

- **Go-Live after each phase:**  
    Intermediate deliveries after completion of each development phase.

### üîÑ Improvement Phases

When sufficient feedback, ideas, or bugs have been collected, we start a new improvement round:

- **Improve phase 1:**  
    Optimization and usability improvements based on real-world experience.

- **Improve phase 2, 3, ‚Ä¶**  
    Follow-up phases addressing batches of new improvements.

This approach ensures we can deliver value quickly and continuously improve.

## 3. App Structure: Functional Domains, Applications, and Use Cases

To keep the roadmap clear, we structure the items on three levels: **Functional Domain, Applications, and Use Cases.**

### üîπ Functional Domains

The functional domains represent the main areas within our applications: Logistics, Purchasing, Sales, CRM, Assortment, Financial, Inventory, Management, and Assets.

### üî∏ Applications and Use Cases

Within each functional domain, we distinguish between various applications and their corresponding use cases. In some cases, the scope of an application is so specific that it has not yet been divided into separate use cases.
